live-contact.js is a simple web chat that allows any visitor of your website to
talk to you live (using the XMPP protocol) without having to install any
additional software or needing to register an account.

live-contact.js is based on the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Strophe](http://strophe.im/strophejs/)

live-contact.js is free software under the terms of the [LGPLv3][1].

## Usage

See the `examples/` directory.

`build.sh` compiles the project.

`run-nginx-dev.sh` runs it locally for testing and developing purposes.
Obviously you have to install [nginx](http://nginx.org/) first.
